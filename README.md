# Powershell-Scripts
Powershell Scripts written during my time as a Network Admin intern.
I was not an administrator (but I did know admin credentials in order to perform certain tasks) so the program is somewhat lacking.
I would add the option to unlock an AD account and directly find usernames via Win32_computersystem if I was an admin.
Nevertheless, this helped me during my work.
